# GNSS


This project intended to update the Rinex_to_CGGTTS code to be able to read CGGTTS new format V3. It was developed under supervision of Pedro Senna Rocha at Brazilian Observatory National. 

Rinex3_to_cggtts.cpp passed in all tests that were made and proved it is able to work with CGGTTS V2 and V3. The code is very messy due to lack of time I had at that time and due to end of the project due to burocratical problems.
