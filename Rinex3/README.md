#RINEX 3

This program is based on Pascale Defraign's program avaliable on BIPM ftp server.

Diferent from original this may combine Rinex 3.xx codes of your choice (that have to be changed in the line 1113 cop1 and cop2) from the constellation of your choice (unless from GLONASS that I still working at) using 16 seconds or another time between observations and with the number of observations (to create the vectors, usually is used 13 minutes) that you want.

I wrote it like the original fortran program so I still have to clean the code and let it more legible but I intend to do this just after ending the GLONASS analysis.
